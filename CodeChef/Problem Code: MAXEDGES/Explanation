if We have N no of vertices then the formula for total no. of edges is

total_edges = n C 2 (combination)  OR N * (N-1) /2;

so we can have two approches 
1. to find the no. of edges that are possible (complex)
2. to find the no. of edhges that are not possible and then subtracting it from total  (Better)


edges_source_to_source = source *(source -1) / 2
edges_sink_to_sink = sink * (sink -1) /2

these two edges are not allowed so we subtract them from total

ans =  total_edges - edges_source_to_source = source *(source -1) / 2   +     edges_sink_to_sink = sink * (sink -1) /2

and we handle those case seprate in which a vertex is a source and sink both 
using if else condition. simply we can remove that vertex and apply the same
